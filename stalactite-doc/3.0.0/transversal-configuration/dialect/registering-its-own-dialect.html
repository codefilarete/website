<h2 id="registering-its-own-dialect">Registering its own Dialect</h2>
<p>Dialects are discovered thanks to the Java Service Provider system: Stalactite will look for subclasses of <code>DialectResolverEntry</code> in
	the classpath. Hence, some files named <code>org.codefilarete.stalactite.sql.DialectResolver$DialectResolverEntry</code> must be present in
	it and should contain a reference to the implementation of <code>DialectResolverEntry</code>: this interface
	contains some methods that work closely:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>getDialect()</code> is expected to return an instance of the Dialect to use</li>
	<li><code>getCompatibility()</code> should return a <code>DatabaseSignet</code> that describes the database (name and version) with which the
		Dialect is compatible
	</li>
	<li><code>getVendorSettings()</code> should return some <code>DatabaseVendorSettings</code> which are the default vendor ones</li>
</ul>
