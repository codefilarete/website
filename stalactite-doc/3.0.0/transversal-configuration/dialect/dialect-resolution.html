<h2 id="dialect-resolution">Dialect resolution</h2>
<p><code>ServiceLoaderDialectResolver</code> manages the way that <code>Dialect</code>s are found and chosen for a
	database connection. As mentionned in <a href="#registering-its-own-dialect">Dialect registration paragraph</a>,
	Stalactite will use the JVM Service Provider system to find the available <code>Dialect</code>s, then it will select
	the &ldquo;best matching&rdquo; one according to the database version (took from JDBC <code>Connection</code> metadata) and the
	database compatibility given by <code>DialectResolverEntry</code> : vendor name must match exactly and the closest
	version is kept, with preference for smaller one. For example, with HSQLDB 2.5.2 (took from database connection),
	an entry giving HSQLDB 2.5.0 will be preferred to a HSQLDB 3.0.0 one.</p>
<p>If this algorithm doesn&rsquo;t suit your need, one can change it by implementing your own
	<code>ServiceLoaderDialectResolver</code> and give it as an argument to <code>PersistenceContext</code> at instantiation time.</p>

<section class="hint success">
	<p>By default, <code>PersistenceContext</code> will auto-discover the adequate Dialect when you pass it a
		<code>DataSource</code> as a constructor argument.</p>
