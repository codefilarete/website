<h1 id="dialect">Dialect</h1>
<p>Dialects aim at adapting SQL to database vendor particularities, hence it is expected to have one Dialect per vendor and even per database version.</p>
<p>For example one can change generated DML (insert, update, delete and select orders) and overall DDL (table, colum, foreign key creation) by overriding method <code>newDDLGenerator()</code>.</p>
