<p>Stalactite uses JDBC Batch for inserts, updates and deletes. But users have to keep in mind that inserts performance can be corrupted by identifier
	policy.</p>
<h3 id="take-caution-to-after-insert-identifier-policy-and-massive-insert">Take caution to after-insert identifier policy and massive insert</h3>
<p>If you use Stalactite to insert values into a single table then you don&rsquo;t have to worry so much about identifier policy. But if you&rsquo;re
	using Stalactite much more to help you persist an object graph and expect good performance then you may encounter some trouble if you used
	after-insert policy.</p>
<p>JDBC batch is used on PreparedStatement, which then expects to have all its values defined, so in case of relational object, and in particular with
	one-to-one owned by source entity, it should know target ids before they&rsquo;re persisted to fill owning column, which is impossible with
	after-insert policy on target entities. As a consequence, in such case, Stalactite should persist target entities before root, and extends this
	mechanism to the whole graph. As a consequence, to benefit from JDBC batch, after-insert policy needs a different graph iteration algorithm than
	other policies. It may be possible, but not done yet !</p>
