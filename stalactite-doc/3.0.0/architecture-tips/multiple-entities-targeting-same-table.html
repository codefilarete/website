<h2 id="multiple-entities-targeting-same-table">Multiple entities targeting the same table</h2>
<p>If you deal with some legacy schema or want to separate some application domains, it is perfectly valid for
	Stalactite to target the same table with different entities. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll have to manage the separation of
	concern of your entities: don&rsquo;t map the same column twice for writing, nor, overall, identifier.</p>
<p>Hence, if you have a huge table with many columns, you may decide to split it over several entities and eventually
	declare some of them as read-only for others.</p>
