<h2 id="defining-constructor">Specifying entity constructor</h2>
<p>By default, Stalactite will lookup for a constructor that takes the <em>entity identifier as argument, if this constructor doesn't exist,
    it will use the no-arg one</em>. But you may change this behavior by specifying the constructor that Stalactite should use through the
    <code>usingConstructor(..)</code> method.
    <br>
    By using a constructor with arguments, your entity can declare its fields as <code>final</code> which can be helpful
    for the identifier of the entity, for example. However, if thinking about the identifier seems obvious, it doesn't mean that it is mandatory for
    the provided factory: you may build your entity from any columns found in the database and let Stalactite set the identifier later for you (by
    any property accessor you provided with <code>mapKey(..)</code>)
    <br>
    Here is a very simple example that makes Stalactite uses the one-arg <code>Person</code> constructor that takes its
    id as argument:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">MappingEase.entityBuilder(Person.class, Long.class)
    .mapKey(Person::getId, IdentifierPolicy.afterInsert())
    .mapMap(Person::getPhoneNumbers, String.class, String.class)
    .usingConstructor(Person::new, "id")
</code></pre>

<p>There are several signatures of the <code>usingConstructor(..)</code> to let user configures Stalactite for its code :
<ul>
    <li>with up to 3 column names, to address constructor with up to 3 arguments</li>
    <li>with up to 3 <code>Column</code>s, to address constructor with up to 3 arguments, as opposed to previous
        signature, this signature enforces constructor arg types since <code>Column</code>s are typed with generics
    </li>
    <li>with the variant <code>usingFactory(Function&lt;Function&lt;Column&lt;?, ?&gt;, ?&gt;, C&gt; row)</code> that lets
        user pick up <code>Column</code> values in its argument</li>
</ul>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Table countryTable = new Table("Country");
Column&lt;Table, Long&gt; idColumn = countryTable.addColumn("id", long.class).primaryKey();
Column&lt;Table, String&gt; nameColumn = countryTable.addColumn("name", String.class);

[...]

.usingFactory(row -> new Country(row.apply(idColumn), row.apply(nameColumn)))
</code></pre>
<p><section class="hint success">
    <p>Since constructor is actually a <code>Function</code>, a factory method can also be used as a constructor: any
        static method, even out of the entity class, can be used as a constructor.</p>
