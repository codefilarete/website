<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>
<p>As your project grows, and features are added, developpers tend to add relations to the existing persistence context, as they would do by
	annotating classes of a classical JPA application.</p>
<p>In the same time, developpers also tend to fetch relations when it is necessary to their feature, but they hardly do it chirurgically : either by
	using EAGER annotation option, or fetching relation in a quite-centralized repository method.</p>
<p>This combo leads to an ever-growing memory footprit since relations are always loaded, even if their properties are not used in all situations.</p>
<h3 id="any-solution-">Any solution ?</h3>
<h4 id="bounded-context">Bounded context</h4>
<p>A better approach would require to create aggregates (or bounded contexts) dedicated to your &ldquo;local&rdquo; feature, as in Command and Query
	Separation (CQS) architecture, implying dedicated JPA persistence contexts for instance. Then those must be named and wisely referenced in code,
	for instance with the Spring @Qualifier annotation.</p>
<h4 id="jpa-namedentitygraph-to-the-rescue-">JPA @NamedEntityGraph to the rescue ?</h4>
<p>Another option would use the JPA <code>@NamedEntityGraph</code> annotation to configure some graph-loading contexts. But this as a drawback : you&rsquo;re
	still using a unique entity graph that is partially loaded, which doesn&rsquo;t help developper to know which relation is loaded or not.</p>
<section class="hint success">
<p>Stalactite promotes the aggregate approach because <strong>you can visualize the graph complexity</strong> when you write your mapping : hundreds
	lines of mapping would warn you about your graph inflation.</p>
</section>
<p>As a second advantage, by chaining your configuration writing, one may be less tempted to persist an intermediary entity and would <strong>always
	access your graph by its root</strong>, which also implies a no-surprise graph loading (no additional surprising select). </p>
