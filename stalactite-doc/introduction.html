<h1>Stalactite introduction</h1>
<h2>What is it ?</h2>
Stalactite aims at being an ORM, but also gives some tools to ease JDBC usage : trying to be an ORM as a framework, but with some modules that
helps to create CRUD SQL statements for Objects.
<br>
To fulfill this goal, the project is devided in 3 main modules :
<ul>
	<li>The <code>orm</code> module : deals with relations between entities and allows persistence description through a fluent API. Depends on <code>core</code>.</li>
	<li>The <code>core</code> module : manages persistence of Objects without relation management. Depends on <code>sql</code>.</li>
	<li>The <code>sql</code> module : a layer on top of JDBC to ease its usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can use <code>core</code> or <code>sql</code> out of <code>orm</code>, but this documentation mainly talks about the <code>orm</code> module.</p>
<section class="hint info">
<p>Stalactite depends on 2 others projects called <em>Reflections</em> and <em>Tool</em> under <code>org.codefilarete</code> groupId, made to decouple things,
	but they are not intended to be used outside this organisation : using them outside it is not supported </p>

<h2 id="why--the-genesis">Why ? The genesis</h2>
Stalactite is born after many years of Hibernate usage on a application with a large domain (implying the creation of more than 200 database tables)
which entities were directly exposed to the view. Over time this appeared to be a misconception since with a classical ORM this leads to a bothering
fetch-all and cache-all solution to avoid lazy initialization error for the former, which caused performance issue, solved by the latter.
Moreover, it comes with the observation that teams hardly master the framework even after years of practice :
<ul>
	<li>putting annotations on files is painless, but after some months of development, entity graph becomes a spaghetti plate where you can't
		get only a piece of it without loading the whole. Then you'll have to add additional annotation such as <code>@NamedEntityGraph</code> to
		specify what you want to load
	</li>
	<li>entity state (attached, detached, etc.) is still a problem for newcomers, and developers still struggle with it after years of practise, or
		have rewritten (even if not optimized) a layer on top of repository to avoid dealing with it
	</li>
	<li>then come the well-known and common exceptions LazyInitializationException, StaleStateObjectException, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<section class="hint info">
	<header>Some particular words about @Annotations usage impact</header>
	By using annotations for mapping, we lack a non-intrusive way of declaring it (HBM/XML is still possible but not officially well maintained), for
	example :
	<ul>
		<li>in a Domain Driven Design project, where Domain must be framework-agnostic, annotations are a problem. To overcome this problem a copy of
			Domain entities can be introduced in persistence module to get a Persistence Domain, helped by a one-one mapper, this introduces
			duplicates
			and boilerplate code. Worth mentioning that bidirectionality between some entity can be quite complex to solve by the mapper.
		</li>
		<li>quickly persisting some data coming from a Controller is not possible before mapping them to entity, which will produce boilerplate code
			or
			reflection overhead.
		</li>
		<li>as long as your project rises in features, and produces relations between entities, the trend brings to obtain a huge entity graph if no
			one
			takes care of it, because it&rsquo;s very hard to quickly see what&rsquo;s going to be loaded or not with annotations. Then performance
			for
			loading it may become a problem, as well as modifying it.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill its goal (having an ORM less complex than Hibernate, with non-intrusive mapping), some choices were made that may hardly change :</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>no query language</em> such as HQL/JPQL : because it&rsquo;s perfomance consuming while parsing the text, and because it&rsquo;s
		time consuming by its complexity for a developer which wants to implement such a project ! For now a fluent API is available for CRUD SQL
		statement writing, as well as a fluent API to describe the may of reading a produced ResultSet.
	</li>
	<li><em>no attach/detach</em> concept, no first-level cache : because Stalactite doesn&rsquo;t need it at first. One reason for having the
		attach concept is to get an easy way to audit changes on entities, so the system can know which modifications should be sent to the database.
		Stalactite uses a difference algorithm computation to find those changes. This has a drawback : when updating an entity, the algorithm needs
		the modified version of the bean, as well as the unmodified version, usually coming from the database (but could be a serialized version of
		it, with risk of being out of sync with database of course). This implies that Stalactite will load your entity graph when you&rsquo;ll use
		the update(..) method, this may seem cumbersome but matches the load-update-persist pattern that happens behind the scene of Hibernate too.
	</li>
	<li><em>no annotations, requires Java 8 at least</em> : as explained above, annotations are not the expected way to define mapping of
		entities because they are too intrusive. So the mapping will be done through Java Method References.
	</li>
	<li><em>no lazy loading, promote bounded context / small aggregate roots</em> : in order to let developers assess what they are doing
		with the database (in terms of performance), and avoid lazy exceptions, <em>relations are always fetched</em>. By this way developer
		is encouraged to create several aggregates instead of one huge entity graph.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus Stalactite <em>doesn&rsquo;t use bytecode enhancement,</em> because it doesn&rsquo;t need to modify given beans nor their
	collections. But it uses reflection to apply values onto beans.</p>
<p>As a good practice, only <code>PreparedStatement</code> are used to avoid SQL Injection. Meanwhile, select statement are not totally protected
	because one can append any kind of Object in the SQL as parameter. So, as a developer, <em>you must care that SQL queries don&rsquo;t
		concatenate unprotected sources</em>.</p>
<section class="hint danger">
<header>Known limitations</header>
<ul>
	<li>for now Stalactite supports only single column identifier</li>
	<li>Stalactite does not support many-to-many relation</li>
	<li>Stalactite is tested against HSQLDB, H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and Derby</li>
</ul>
